Apart from a few words (okay, just _tomato_) I pass as a native American
English speaker but there are a few aspects of this dialect that almost
twenty years on still grate on me.

## Pluralizing The First Word In Job Titles

"Attorneys General" is a mouthful and stupid. The job title is "Attorney General"
and it can be unambigously pluralized as "Attorney Generals" without giving anyone
command of an army.

## Caramel

It's pronounced _car**a**mel_, not _carmel_. That's the
[place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California) where
Clint Eastwood was mayor. Lovely but not delicious.

## Write Me

Sure, _call me_, but _write to me_. I can't explain but if _on accident_ annoys you then maybe you can relate.
