I live in Alameda, California with my wife, daughters and a cat or two.
The [Chochenyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chochenyo) are the traditional
owners of the land where we live.

I mostly grew up in Western Australia but I've lived in the San Francisco Bay
Area since early 2001.

I like to make food, software, music and trouble. I get paid to make software.
At the moment Google pays me to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/).
In the past my work has included software and services to allow people to
discover and engage with music, operating systems for unusually shaped
computers and weird web browsers.
I believe [software freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
is important and choose [licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html)
that preserve the rights of users when sharing my own software.
